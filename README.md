Any fools can know. The point is to understand. - Albert Einstein

Pull up in the monster automobile gangster. With that bitch that came from Sri Lanka.
Yeah I'm in a tanka color of Willy Wonka. You can be the king but watch the queen conquer.
First thing first I eat you brain.
And then Imma start rock gold teeth and fangs.
Coz that what a motherfucking monster do.
Hairdresser from Milan that's a monster do.
Monster Geuseppi heels that the monster shoes.
Young money is the rasta that's a monnster crew.
And I'm all up all up all up in the bank with a funny face.
And if I'm face I aint notice cause my money aint.
